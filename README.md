CRL-YOLO11
Overview


The proposed CRL-YOLOv11 integrates a Context-Guided Coordinate Attention Block (CGCAB), re-parameterized multi-branch aggregation, and a Lightweight Asymmetric Decoupled Head (LADH-Head), specifically designed for robust underwater fish detection under low contrast, blurred, or occluded conditions.
