# 🐟 CRL-YOLO11：

CRL-YOLO11 is a lightweight object detection algorithm designed for complex underwater environments. It is specifically optimized for challenges such as low contrast, small targets, and degraded edge details. Built upon the YOLOv11 architecture, CRL-YOLO11 integrates edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale feature fusion modules, striking a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and model size. This makes it suitable for real-time underwater detection and deployment on edge devices.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Edge-Aware and Context-Guided Attention Module (CGCAB)**  
  Combines standard and dilated convolutions to extract both local details and global context, and introduces Coordinate Attention (CA) to enhance the modeling of weak features and edge details.

- 🧩 **Lightweight Feature Aggregation Module (RGCSPELAN)**  
  Uses a re-parameterized multi-branch structure for efficient cross-scale semantic fusion, enhancing detection performance for small objects while reducing parameter redundancy.

- ⚙️ **Lightweight Asymmetric Decoupled Head (LADH-Head)**  
  Incorporates DSConv in the regression branch to reduce computation and uses point-wise convolutions in the classification branch to improve channel-wise feature interaction, enabling a symmetric and lightweight detection head.

- 📉 **Fewer Parameters, Faster Inference, Higher Accuracy**  
  Compact and fast, CRL-YOLO11 is ideal for deployment on embedded platforms or real-time detection scenarios.
